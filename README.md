## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Hardware:** Flipper Zero, Wi-Fi Dev Board  
- **Software:** QFlipper, Marauder Firmware, Wireshark, Hashcat  
- **Techniques:** Evil Portal phishing, deauthentication attacks, WPA2 handshake capture, signal emulation

---

## 🧪 Lab Summary

- Jailbroke Flipper Zero using Unleashed firmware
- Created rogue Wi-Fi access points to simulate phishing
- Captured 4-way WPA2 handshakes for potential cracking with Hashcat
- Used Wireshark to analyze PCAPs from packet captures
- Evaluated attack limitations on modern security like WPA3 and rolling codes

## 💡 Key Findings

- Despite being marketed as plug-and-play, real functionality requires technical knowledge
- Flipper Zero is mostly ineffective against properly secured environments (WPA3, hardware MFA)
- Accessibility—not capability—is the bigger risk
- Educational value is significant for aspiring cybersecurity professionals
